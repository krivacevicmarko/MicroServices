# MicroServices project
# The project consists of three main microservices: the client, reservation service, and notification service. In my project, I use Zuul as the API Gateway for routing and load balancing traffic between microservices, while Eureka is used for dynamic service discovery. There is also a mail service responsible for sending email notifications to users via the notification service.
